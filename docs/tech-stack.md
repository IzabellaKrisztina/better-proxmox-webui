### BHVR Technology Stack Overview

The [BHVR](https://bhvr.dev/getting-started) stack combines modern, high-performance tools to build fast and scalable web applications:

1. **Bun** – A lightning-fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager. Bun serves as the backbone of the stack, offering superior performance for running server-side code and managing dependencies efficiently.

2. **Hono** – A minimalist, high-performance web framework for Bun. Hono is designed for building APIs and server-side applications with low overhead and great developer ergonomics.

3. **Vite** – A next-generation frontend build tool that provides instant hot module replacement (HMR) and lightning-fast builds. Vite ensures your development experience stays smooth and productive, especially when working with modern frontend frameworks.

4. **React** – The popular component-based UI library. React integrates seamlessly with Vite, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces efficiently.

5. **Turborepo** – A high-performance monorepo management tool. Turborepo allows you to manage multiple projects (frontend, backend, shared libraries) in a single repository, with incremental builds, task orchestration, and caching to speed up development and CI/CD workflows.

**How it works together:**
Bun powers the runtime and backend with Hono, while Vite and React handle the frontend. Turborepo ties it all together for multi-project management, caching, and efficient builds. This combination results in a unified, high-performance development experience covering everything from fast API responses to a reactive, responsive UI and streamlined monorepo workflows.
